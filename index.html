          <h3>A Kid Named Cudi</h3>

          We open with popcorn and the opening credits of a movie. Starring Cudi. This mixtape acts as a trailer to the movie you are about to watch; it gives you an idea of what to expect and shows you a bit of who the character is.
          
          
          
          <h3>Man on the Moon: The End of Day</h3>
          
          This is all of the same footage we saw before (with maybe a few scenes scrapped) but this is the entire film now. We explore Cudi's struggles with night terrors as well as the drugs he uses to cope with them and their ultimate failure to effectively do so, and his hope for the future. He knows that he has been sent here for a reason and trying to learn how to survive on this planet Earth of which is not his home. He declares that this will be his world.

          <h3>Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager</h3>
          
          On Earth Cudi welcomes us to the world he is now ruling and calls for a revolution. Then somewhere in the celebrations things have gone too far and we meet Cudi's alter ego Mr. Rager. Cudi wrestles with this persona and it seems Cudi has come out victorious until he realizes that he has become a Ghost.

          <h3>Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven</h3>
          
          Cudi finds himself falling into Hell trying to make sense of it all. He doesn't seem to have come to grips with the fact that he has died. We explore all of Cudi's darkest emotions and thoughts. He doesn't seem to have the ambition to do anything about his situation.

          <h3 style=line-height: 10px;>Passion Pain & Demon Slayin'</h3>
          
          Cudi finds Heaven within himself again and fights his way out of hell as the Rose Golden Cosmic Warrior. He tells the lost dead souls around him to tune in to his frequency to follow him back to the light.

          <h3>Indicud</h3>
          
          Cudi is resurrected, and feels immortal now. He celebrates making it out and reconnects with his friends and family. He calls out those who wronged him and gives one last fuck you before heading home for the Moon.

          <h3>Satellite Flight: Journey to Mother Moon</h3>
          
          Cudi takes off and flies to the Moon, touching down on Copernicus Crater. He feels bitter and like nobody wants him on Earth. Despite everything he is still a Troubled Boy.

          <h3>WZRD</h3>
          
          It seems to pick up directly after Satellite Flight and continue that same theme. Cudi is home on the moon for better or for worse.</p>
